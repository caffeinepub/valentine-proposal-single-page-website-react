  "summary": "The diff updates the proposal grid to render 6 static photo tiles via a new StaticPhotoTile component and removes visible local-upload UI from App.tsx, while adding per-tile fallback placeholders. However, the actual 6 JPG assets requested are not shown as added in the diff summary, and there are unrelated style/config/HTML changes not requested.",

      "id": "REQ-18",
      "requirement": "Add the 6 newly uploaded images as static frontend assets and ensure they are included in the build output with these exact filenames.",
      "reason": "The diff summary does not show any of the six .jpg files being added to the repo (e.g., under a public/static assets directory). App.tsx references them, but their existence/inclusion in the build output cannot be verified from the provided changes.",
